### Hey! ✨

Hello there, I'm Lartu. I'm mostly a [game](https://lartu.itch.io) developer, but I'm also interested in writing small esoterical programming languages.
I co-founded [Stonehollow Workshop](https://stonehollow-workshop.com). I created the [LDPL Programming Language](https://ldpl-lang.org/), first as a joke,
then not so much. I've made some other stuff too. I love rainy days! I also keep a list of the things I've worked on at [www.lartu.net](https://www.lartu.net/).
